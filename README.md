patternfly-design is awesome!
=============================

The "patternfly-design" repo houses the design documentation for the PatternFly project. Accepted content will be merged into the "patternfly-design" repo, so that they can appear on the [patternfly.org](https://www.patternfly.org), website.

This open format enables contributors to easily access and contribute design documentation and assets. It also has the benefit of dramatically reducing overhead for posting to [patternfly.org](https://www.patternfly.org), as the site can automatically consume the markdown files submitted by designers.

A listing and status of the design patterns in this site is available at: http://www.patternfly.org/patternfly-design/status/ 

To learn more about how you can contribute to PatternFly visit our [Get Started](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/wiki/home) page.

Designing with Git
--

We understand that many designers may not be familiar with Git, and have prepared a set of instructions that outline a workflow using the Git GUI tool [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com). This tool is not necessary to contribute, but we feel that it provides a good starting point for beginners, and is robust enough to be useful for more advanced use-cases as well.
