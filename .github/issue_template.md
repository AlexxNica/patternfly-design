###### *Have you checked this GitHub backlog, to see if there is any work, in progress, that may impact your work?*
#### 7. Design Concepts  
###### *Attach any rough sketches, undocumented wireframes or workflows that will help us to understand the pattern you would like to submit.*

#### 8. Scope  
###### *Specify the approximate size of the work for this issue, SM, MD, LG, XL, by applying the relevant GitHub label to this issue.*
#### 9. Assign
