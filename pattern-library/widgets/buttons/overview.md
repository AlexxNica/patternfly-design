Buttons communicate an action that the user can take when they interact with them. There are a number of types of buttons than can be used and depending on the use case, it is recommended to make use of the following examples.

## Usage Examples

  1. Close button:
    - If closing a modal, follow the [Modal Widget](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/widgets/#modal) guidelines.
    - If referring to closing another type of view use "Close" as a secondary button.
  1. Delete button:
   - "Delete" should be used in a secondary button unless you have a limited use case where the Delete action is a highly destructive action. In that case, use the destructive button. Ideally, a delete button would be followed up with a confirmation modal for the user to confirm this action.
  1. Cancel button:
   - "Cancel" should be used in a secondary button unless you have a limited use case where the Cancel action is a highly destructive action. In that case, use the destructive button.
