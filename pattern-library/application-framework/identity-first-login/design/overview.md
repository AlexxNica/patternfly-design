# Identity First Login

Jump to [Login Page](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/application-framework/login-page/) or [Single Sign On](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/application-framework/single-sign-on/)

## Identity First
When identity first, a user will input the username and password separately and may not be required a password when other authentication mechanisms are used (for example fingerprint, two-way ssl, etc.). Also, it allows automatically redirecting to an external IdP when the user is linked to an external IdP.
