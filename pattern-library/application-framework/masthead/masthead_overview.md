# Masthead

## Overview

There are two options for the masthead design, one short option to save space and one tall option to accommodate for larger product logos. The order of information remains consistent regardless of whether you are using the tall or the short masthead design.

For [Horizontal Navigation](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/navigation/horizontal-navigation/#_), we recommend the shorter design to reduce vertical real estate, accommodating for the navigation. However, if additional rebranding capabilities are desired, there is an option for a taller masthead which will include a product logo.

For [Vertical Navigation](https://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/navigation/vertical-navigation/#_), we recommend the taller design, with the hamburger menu always visible in the top left corner.
