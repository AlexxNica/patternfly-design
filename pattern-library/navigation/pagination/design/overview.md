# Pagination

## Overview

This pattern defines how pagination behaves within content views. When present, it is consistent across all three content views.

* Pagination is found below the content.
* Pagination is optional.
  * When there is a small number of items.
  * When content uses "lazy load" to load content as a user scrolls.
* Pagination can be "sticky" and remain fixed to the bottom of a user's browser.
