# Pagination

## Overview

This pattern defines how pagination behaves within the table, list, and card content views.

Pagination is found below the content. Pagination is optional. When present, it includes:

* Number of items on a page
* Items currently displayed
* Current page / navigate to specific page
* Total number of pages
* Navigate to the next or previous page
* Navigate to the first or last page
