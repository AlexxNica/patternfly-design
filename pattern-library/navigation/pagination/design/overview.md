# Pagination

## Overview

This pattern defines how pagination behaves within the table, list, and card content views.

The persistent elements related to pagination would be found below the content. This includes:

* See the number of items on a page and total number of pages
* See how many pages of data there is.
* View which page you are on (current location)
* Modify how many pages are being displayed.
* Skip to the next or previous page.
* Skip multiple pages.
* Navigate to the first/last page.
