# Modal Overlay

The Modal Overlay pattern provides a way to quickly load and display important information to the user without navigating away from the current page. Use cases for Modal Overlays can vary a great deal, but some examples include the following:
  - To collect data from users
  - To remind or prompt users
  - To load dialogs that require user input before advancing
  - To load tasks which require a user's full attention, such as stepping through a wizard flow
  - To present important information or warnings

The main difference between the Modal Overlay and the [Modeless Overlay](https://) is that the Modal Overlay will dim the background and will not allow users to interact with other areas of the page, while the Modeless Overlay will not require users to close the panel prior to performing other actions on the page.
