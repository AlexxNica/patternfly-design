# Sort

![Image highlighting attribute selector](img/sort_expand.png)

  1. **Sort Selector:** Contains a list of the possible attributes by which to sort. Objects can be sorted by any attribute that they possess, not just those that are delayed on the page. (e.g. attributes in hidden columns, or those that are not displayed in a tile)

  1. **Sort Order Toggle:** Toggles between ascending and descending order for the current sort. The icon on this button changes according to the data type of the current sort (use fa-sort-alpha-descending ![Image of sort](img/fa-sort-alpha-desc.png) and fa-sort-alpha-ascending ![Image of sort](img/fa-sort-alpha-asc.png) for strings, and fa-sort-numeric-descending ![Image of sort](img/fa-sort-numeric-desc.png) and fa-sort-numeric-ascending ![Image of sort](img/fa-sort-numeric-asc.png) for integers). Defaults to ascending order.
