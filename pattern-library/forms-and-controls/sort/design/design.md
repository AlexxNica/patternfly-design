![Image highlighting attribute selector](img/sort_expand.png)

  1. **Sort Selector:** Contains a list of the possible attributes by which to sort. Objects may be sorted by any attribute, including properties that are not displayed in the current view. (e.g. attributes in hidden columns, or those that are not displayed in a tile)

  1. **Sort Order Toggle:** Sort can toggle between ascending and descending order. The icon on this button changes according to the order of the current sort (use fa-sort-alpha-descending ![Image of sort](img/fa-sort-alpha-desc.png) for descending and fa-sort-alpha-ascending ![Image of sort](img/fa-sort-alpha-asc.png) for ascending). The default for sort is ascending order."
