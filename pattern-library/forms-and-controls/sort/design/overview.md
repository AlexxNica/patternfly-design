# Sort

Sort enables users to quickly sort a table or page full of objects by a single attribute. Sorting helps users make sense of data by ordering it in a logical fashion. Sort is often displayed as a component of the [Toolbar](http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/forms-and-controls/toolbar/).

When the current data is displayed as a table with sortable columns, the sort widget should still be included in the data toolbar for that view (changing the sort widget should change the appearance of the sortable table headers and vice versa).
