# Conditional Hidden Fields Based on User Selection

## Overview

This pattern uses progressive disclosure to hide and show fields based on a particular selection. The workflow is simple and the user can focus on the task at hand. This approach saves usersâ€™ time from unnecessarily identifying what fields can or cannot be interacted with. This approach is also helpful to color-blind users because it avoids using color to indicate whether or not a field is available.

## Description

The pattern addresses three examples of conditional fields:

1. [Single level conditional fields](#single_level)

1. [Conditional fields with drop-down menu](#drop_down)

1. [Multi level conditional fields](#multi_level)

## Examples
