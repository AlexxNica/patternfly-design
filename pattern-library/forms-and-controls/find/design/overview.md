# Find

The find pattern is used to locate objects in a large dataset by entering a query. Unlike filter, find does not remove non-matching objects from view so it can be used to sift through a large dataset without losing the context provided by other displayed items. Find is displayed as a component of the Data Toolbar.

Find should not be used in the following cases:
- Paging is used and find cannot work across all pages.
- Infinite scrolling is used and find cannot work across the entire data set.
