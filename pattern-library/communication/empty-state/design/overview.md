# Empty State

The goal of a empty state pattern is to provide a good first impression that helps users to achieve their goals. It should be used when a view is empty because no objects exists and you want to guide the user to perform specific actions.

This pattern should NOT be used when:

- Selected filters cause an empty result.
- There is a connectivity issue and the data set cannot be obtained.
